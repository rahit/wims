WIMS v1.0
====

WIMS(Where Is My Stuff) is an opensource item tracking application for android. Keep track of your valuable items such as pendrive, ID card, important docs, keys etc easily.

I tried to keep it as simple as possible so that you can easily use this app. Because you definitely don't want to give much time to just save infos about your staff to just keep track of those.

How to Use
----------

**Add an Item**
- Click on Menu and Select "Add Item".
- Then Enter the Item name and its location and click "Add"
- You will see a small pop-up that your item is successfully added and you can see the item in Home Screen list.

**Edit an Item**
An item doesn't belong to a specific place all the time. You may place it in another location. So, you need to update it's location so that you can keep track of it. Here is how you can update it's location.

- From Home Screen click on the item you wish to update
- In the Edit Item screen, edit and update the information you want to update and hit "Update" button.
- That's it. You will see updated info in the list.

**Delete an Item**
To Delete an Item just select the item from home screen as you did to Edit. Then you will see a button at the bottom of the screen. Click on it to Delete the item.

Future Update:
---------------
I have plan to add some more features to this app.

- Show the date and time, when the last time a item is modified. So that you can remember when exactly we moved that item.
- Better UI
- Add pic with your item.
